# web-scrapping-challenge

Code should be working and running without errors. Both jupyter files with the code are in there, and I added csv files for every DataFrame there is. Although the main DataFrame is "mars_data".

The initial code was created by edX Boot Camps LLC. The [Mars News website](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) is operated by edX Boot Camps LLC for educational purposes only. The news article titles, summaries, dates, and images were scraped [from NASA's Mars NewsLinks](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/) website in November 2022. Images are used according to the [JPL Image Use Policy](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jpl-image-use-policy/), courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech. The code was written bt David Ruvalcaba.
